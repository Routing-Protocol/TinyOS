This application periodically toggles between sending odd and even binary digits and receives the count on two nodes.

The application requires a minimum of two nodes. The receving nodes are to be named node 3 and node 4. The same application can be installed on the all motes since the application has both the transmitter and the receiving parts. The received count is displayed on the leds of nodes 3 and 4.

The expected result would be the periodically toggled display of odd and even binary numbers on each mote, 3 or 4.
